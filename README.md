# Prediction-in-time-series-dataset

Performed time series prediction on Road Dataset.

Procedure:

Used Decision Tree Classifier to Predict the values.
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
